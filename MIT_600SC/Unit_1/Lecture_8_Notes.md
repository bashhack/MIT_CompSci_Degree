# MIT 6.00SC - Lecture 8 Notes
# ============================

* The goal in our study of computation efficiency is not to become experts -
  as this is a much greater task than we can cover in a semester. Instead,
  we will aim to develop an 'intuition' for how to approach the question
  of efficiency.

* Why is efficiency so important? Though computers are fast, and powerful, in
  their computational abilities, some problems are enormous.

* Given the scale of problems we face in computer science, these concerns
  can mean the difference between days and years.

* Efficiency is about choosing the right algorithm(s), not about coding details.

* A successful computer scientist might invent only a single meaningful
  algorithm in their career - most never having discovered any.

* The key is: Reduce it to a previously solved problem!

* Efficiency is measured in both SPACE and TIME - we can often trade
  one for the other.

* We begin thinking of computational efficiency with a general recommendation
  to count the steps a computation will take for an input of that size.

* When we think about how long an algorithm will take to run, there are
  a few ways to look at it:
  - Best Case:
  - Worst Case:
  - Ideal Case:
