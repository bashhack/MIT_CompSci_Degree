# MIT 6.00SC - Lecture 5 Notes
# ==========================

* Lists, Dicts, and Tuples are collections/seqs data structures

* Tuples and Lists are ORDERED!!!!

* Tuples are immutable!

* Slice: subsequence of tuple or list

* Append: is a method (i.e., L.append(e) => append(L, e))

* For dicts, the 'keys' (vs tuple/lists indices) can be any immutable type

* A dict is a set of <key, value> pairs

# Check Yourself
# ==========================

1) What is mutability?
"Mutability is a property describing an object's ability to change, that is a mutable
object can be updated/modified in place. Immutable objects cannot be changed."

2) What is the important difference between a list and a tuple?
"A tuple is immutable, whereas a list is mutable."

3) What is cloning?
"Cloning an object allows us to make a new reference, often useful when wanting to
avoid mutation of the original object."

4) What are the important aspects of a dictionary?
"Dictionaries, though another collection data structure for Python, are unique in that
they are mutable with immutable keys. The <key, value> pair relationship inherent to
the data structure is also essential to our understanding and application of dictionaires,
as this varies from the integer-based indexing we have seen with other collection data types."
