# Problem Set 1 - B
# =============================================================================
# Write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in
# order to pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. We will not be
# dealing with a minimum monthly payment rate.

# Take as `raw_input` the following floating point numbers:
# 1) the oustanding balance on the credit card
# 2) annual interest rate as a decimal

# Print out the fixed minimum monthly payment, number of months (at most 12,
# but possibly less) it takes to pay off the debt, and the balance (likely to
# be a negative number).

# Assume the interest is compounded monthly according to the balance at the
# start of the month (before the payment for the month is made). The monthly
# payment must be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months. Notice
# that it is possible for the balance to become negative using this
# payment scheme. In short:

# MONTHLY INTEREST RATE: Annual interest rate / 12.0
# UPDATED BALANCE EACH MONTH: Previous balance * (1 + Monthly Interest Rate) - Minimum monthly payment
